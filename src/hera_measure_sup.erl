% The child process is started by using the start function as defined in the child specification (if not simple_one_for_one).
% Here, it is a simple_one_for_one. The child specification defined in Module:init/1 is used (which is "hera_measure"), and ChildSpec must instead be an arbitrary list of terms List. 
% The child process is then started by appending List to the existing start function arguments, that is, by calling apply(M, F, A++List), where {M,F,A} is the start function defined 
% in the child specification.
% So, a hera_measure is launched.
